## 🧭 1. Core Concept
You are a blacksmith working in a neutral city — a trade hub caught between two warring factions.  
The forge never sleeps; you work the same shift every day while the world outside shifts with the tides of war.  
Each day, you craft items for clients from both sides — generals, monks, deserters, merchants — and slowly watch how the conflict shapes the city around you.  

Your creations might fuel peace or destruction, but the forge remains your world.

## 🔥 2. Core Loop

**1. Begin Shift**  
- The previous blacksmith finishes and leaves a few words of warning or exhaustion.  
- You begin your shift and read the day’s **client board** — new commissions arrive from various factions and civilians.  
- You can only complete a few before your time runs out.

**2. Crafting (Gameplay Section)**  
- Crafting is represented as *a videogame within the game* — mechanics to be designed later.  
- It may involve rhythm, timing, or entirely abstract systems that symbolize focus and mastery.  
- The items you craft may bring various consequences to the world.

**3. End of Shift – The Newspaper Delivery**  
- When your shift ends, the forge quiets.  
- A **newspaper boy** (or messenger, depending on era style) stops by and tosses a folded paper onto your workbench.  
- You can **ignore it** or **read it**.  

  - **If you read it:**  
    - You learn what’s happening in the world — troop movements, city politics, and public rumors.  
    - The **map on the wall updates** to reflect the new frontlines and faction influence.  
    - The next day’s clients and dialogue respond to your awareness — people comment on things you’ve read.  

  - **If you ignore it:**  
    - The world still moves on without you.  
    - The **map remains unchanged** (you remain uninformed).  
    - The forge’s **environment subtly changes** to reflect unseen events — smoke thickens, new banners appear, the soundscape shifts.  
    - You may unlock **unique dialogue options** with clients who mention rumors or confront your indifference.  

- As the conflict develops, the city’s mood, visuals, and sounds continue to evolve: propaganda posters, new flags, broken windows, different soldiers walking past outside.  

**4. Continuity**  
- The player remains the same blacksmith, witnessing the war from a fixed point.  
- You see only what passes through your forge and what’s written (or left unread) in the papers.  
- Over time, both factions change tone — ideals fade, compromises grow, and neutrality becomes fragile.

## 🛠️ 3. Gameplay Systems

| System | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shift System** | Each session represents one work shift (~10–20 min). When a shift ends, the results of your previous work appear **through three channels**: the *newspaper* (world events), the *forge environment* (visual and auditory changes), and the *clients* (their dialogue and new requests). |
| **Client Requests** | Each shift brings new customers representing both factions and civilians. Their tone and intent reflect current events from the newspaper and environment. |
| **Crafting Mini-Game** | Placeholder — will be “some videogame” that expresses the meditative act of forging. The specific mechanics are undecided. |
| **Newspaper Delivery** | At shift’s end, a messenger delivers the daily paper. Reading it reveals headlines and updates the map. Ignoring it allows the world to move on unseen — the environment still changes, and new dialogue emerges. |
| **Forge Environment** | The interior subtly transforms to mirror the city’s shifting state — new posters, banners, smoke, sounds of gunfire or silence. The environment tells the emotional truth behind the newspaper’s propaganda. |
| **Return Events** | Old creations occasionally reappear with changed meanings (a bell melted into bullets, a sword displayed in a museum). These encounters occur naturally through clients. |

## 🌫 4. Narrative & Themes

**Setting:**  
A neutral industrial city serving as the last trading hub between two empires at war.  
Both sides secretly commission weapons, tools, and spiritual artifacts from your forge.  

**Philosophical focus:**  
- **Impermanence:** The map shifts, factions rise and fall, but the forge persists.  
- **Non-attachment:** You can’t stop the war; you only decide what to make.  
- **Observation:** Reading the paper becomes an act of mindfulness — learning what happened without intervening.  
- **Moral ambiguity:** Both sides speak of peace but use your work for power.  

**Narrative delivery:**  
- The daily paper provides fragmented world news and consequences.  
- The forge window and interior subtly change, mirroring conflict intensity.  
- Coworkers, clients, or the delivery boy comment on events with brief, suggestive dialogue.

## 💡 5. Art & Sound Direction

**Visuals:**  
- 2D side-view forge interior, with the map visible on the wall.  
- Light changes by faction influence: red for one, blue for another, dull grey for neutrality.  
- Through the window: city skyline, smoke columns, banners shifting colors as control changes.  
- Small touches: scattered newspapers, new posters, ration cards, bullet holes.  

**Audio:**  
- Rhythmic hammer strikes, breathing fire, and wind.  
- Music minimalistic and reactive: war tension grows subtly through drones and percussion.

## 🎮 6. Player Experience Goals

- Feel absorbed in a quiet routine while sensing chaos beyond your walls.  
- Decide whether to engage with the news or remain focused on your work.  
- See how the world evolves from indirect observation — not heroism.  
- Experience stillness amid moral tension.

## 🕰 7. Example Shift Flow

1. Fade in — forge at dusk. Previous smith leaves, muttering about shortages.  
2. Check the board for new requests: a general’s sword, a monk’s bell, a rebel’s dagger.  
3. Choose which to fulfill. Craft them through “some videogame.”  
4. End shift — fire fades, sounds quiet.  
5. Newspaper boy arrives and tosses the daily paper onto your bench.  
6. Option:
   - **Ignore it:**  
     - The world still moves on; the environment subtly changes overnight.  
     - The map remains the same, reflecting your limited awareness.  
     - New dialogue options may appear with clients who comment on things you “should have heard.”  
   - **Read it:**  
     - Headlines summarize conflict progress and outcomes of your previous work.  
     - The map updates — one faction gains ground, the other loses.  
     - Clients next shift acknowledge your awareness of recent events.  
7. Next shift begins; the forge’s environment now reflects the current political state.

## ⚖️ 8. Progression & Replayability

- Faction lines shift visually and narratively as the player continues working.  
- Certain crafted items can influence headlines or turn points in subtle ways.  
- Ignoring or reading the newspaper alters future client dialogue and tone.  
- The city’s neutrality can collapse depending on patterns of choice.  
- Replayability lies in watching different balances of power and moral tones emerge.
